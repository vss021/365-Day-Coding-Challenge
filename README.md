# 365 Days of Coding Challenge

Welcome to my 365 days of coding challenge! This personal project is aimed at enhancing my coding skills and deepening my understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through daily practice and learning.

## Project Overview

The goal of this challenge is to dedicate time each day to coding practice, focusing primarily on improving proficiency in DSA concepts. By consistently working on coding problems, implementing algorithms, and participating in coding challenges, I aim to strengthen my problem-solving abilities and become a more proficient programmer.

## Key Objectives

1. **Daily Coding Practice:** Commit to solving coding problems or implementing algorithms every day.
2. **Focus on DSA:** Prioritize learning and mastering Data Structures and Algorithms concepts.
3. **Participate in Challenges:** Engage in coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codeforces.
4. **Track Progress:** Maintain a log or journal to track daily progress, challenges faced, and lessons learned.
5. **Community Engagement:** Share insights, code snippets, and experiences with the coding community through social media or coding forums.

## Tech Stack

This challenge doesn't rely on any specific tech stack. However, I may choose to use programming languages like Python, JavaScript, or Java, depending on the problem requirements and personal preference.

## Getting Started

1. **Commitment:** Dedicate time each day for coding practice, even if it's just for a few minutes.
2. **Learning Resources:** Utilize online platforms, books, tutorials, and coding challenges to enhance DSA knowledge.
3. **Consistency:** Stay consistent with daily coding practice, even on busy days.
4. **Reflection:** Reflect on daily progress, challenges faced, and areas for improvement.

## Progress Tracking
